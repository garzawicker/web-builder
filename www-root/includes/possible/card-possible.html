        <h4><i>
            A thriving urban university that fosters student success through classroom-to-career connections, relevant degrees and excellent faculty.
          </i></h4>

        <p>
          Build and operate satellites at an innovative aerospace company. Make beer at a legendary brewery. Produce an Emmy-winning newscast. Without leaving campus.
          That’s possible at Metropolitan State University of Denver.</p>
        <p>
          Based in the heart of the Mile High City, MSU Denver provides unparalleled access to internships and professional networks that jump-start careers. Just ask this “SportsCenter” anchor.
          Professors with experience in their industries? We’ve got those, too: the former director of the NCIS, the convention director of Denver’s Comic Con and a biologist who got bitten by the mosquito bug.
        </p>
        <h4>The possibilities are endless.</h4>

        <h4><i>
            99% of our classes are taught by faculty, not teaching assistants. They are industry icons, national experts and have the highest degrees in their disciplines.
          </i></h4>

        <p>
          Learn to fight crime from the former director of the NCIS. Analyze graphic novels with the convention director of Denver’s Comic Con. Get bitten by the insect bug with a renowned mosquito biologist.</p>
        <p>
          That’s possible at Metropolitan State University of Denver.</p>
        <p> Our professors are experts in their fields, but even better at passing on their expertise to students. </p>
        <p>
          How? Hands-on learning built into every academic program. Whether it’s tracking storms outside the city, painting murals for local nonprofits or 3-D printing parts for Colorado space companies. </p>
        <p>
          And learning from industry icons isn’t limited to the classroom. In the last year, we’ve had former presidents, media personalities and literary luminaries on campus to share their knowledge.
