      Dr. Peter Schimpf is a professor and Chair of the Department of Music at Metropolitan State University of
      Denver. He has taught courses in music history, world music, music appreciation, and the history of Rock
      and Roll. He is the founder and director of the MSU Denver Early Music Ensemble, which in 2013 received
      an Early Music America Ensemble Development Grant to stage Cavalieriâ€™s Rappresentatione di anima et di
      corpo at MSU Denver. He has developed additional performing opportunities for students in African
      drumming and Balinese gamelan. He earned a Ph.D. from Indiana University in musicology, and has a BM in
      performance from California State University Sacramento where he studied guitar and lute with Dr. Richard
      Savino. His research interests are as varied as his teaching load, including the influence of non-Western
      musical traditions on Western composers, the revision and development of music appreciation and other
      traditional survey courses, and performance practice on the lute and theorbo. He has published articles on
      the music and career of composer Henry Cowell, and he has presented papers at international, national, and
      regional conferences of the College Music Society, the Society for American Music, and the American
      Musicological Society. As a performer on period instruments, he has been featured as a soloist, and he has
      performed with Seicento Baroque Ensemble and the Denver Early Music
